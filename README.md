Data visualization is viewed by many disciplines as a modern equivalent of visual communication.
A primary goal of data visualization is to communicate information clearly and efficiently via statistical graphics, plots and information graphics. Numerical data may be encoded using dots, lines, or bars, to visually communicate a quantitative message.
Effective visualization helps users analyze and reason about data and evidence.
